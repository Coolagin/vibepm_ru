# How to "Vibe Product Management"

Instructions on how to create a PRD that works well with AI coding assistants like Cursor.ai.

We have two main documents:

1. You need to read `how_to_use_this_prd_with_ai_tools.md` to understand how to use this PRD with AI tools. It's a must read. Must follow. No cutting corners here.

2. `prd_template.md` is the template you should use to create your PRD. This document has a complete PRD template that you can use to structure, and simplify according to your context. In that case, take into account that you are not providing the full picture and instructions to the AI Agent.
